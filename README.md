# employee-tracker

## Description

The motivation of this project is to build a content management system (CMS) that uses the command line to manage a company's employee database. The application is powered by Node.js, npm Inquirer, and MySQL. It uses the MySQL2 package to connect to a MySQL database and performs queries based on the user's input via the Inquirer package. The key concepts of this project are making asynchronous queries to a MySQL database while using an object oriented programming approach. The project supports modularity by organizing the code into appropriate directories.
